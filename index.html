<p>Hi, I'm Ross, I'm a 17-year-old student living in the UK with a fascination for programming.<br /><br />
I hope you find my stuff useful, and if there's anything you need to know, don't feel intimidated to ask.<br /><br />
If you want to use any of my code, it's more than likely licensed under a free, copyleft licence, so as long as you follow the terms set out there, it's absolutely fine. Contributions are also welcome.</p>
