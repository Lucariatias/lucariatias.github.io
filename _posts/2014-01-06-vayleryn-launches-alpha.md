![Vayleryn Alpha](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/etC_xlkDXOYMo1W6887L5grhfIX8LvgBGHW8oNnQNkmsxLdpNVDsApp7p4hfNhh4HY1qLNXXjrsn6Jgxp5MVEG4T6q0rBSwCky3QhOtDj3ACXMMecb3znunhZA)

A couple of weeks ago, Vayleryn launched alpha.
I was meaning to post about this, being a monumental occasion and all, but kind of pushed it back and pushed it back as more important things came up.
But hey, it's definitely worth a look at, even in this early stage, we're not only implementing some of the most weird and innvative features in the Minecraft universe, we seem to have some of the most awesome community members I've seen around in a long time.
So, go keep up to date with it because as far as RP servers go, it's one to watch, even if I do say so myself.
