Okay, so I haven't posted in a while.
Sorry about that.
Since the last time I posted, things got a little crazy and I haven't really set aside the time to write up any proper posts.

The first thing that happened was Vayleryn essentially died and whatever remained was merged into Wayward Realms.
Wayward Realms is a fair bit bigger and has been going pretty well - check out the website [here](http://wayward-realms.net/).
There's been a few critical bugs over the last few days, which I've managed to fix, but it's been quite stressful.

I entered Ludum Dare 29 over last weekend. You can check out the game I made over on the games page.

I've also started work on an RPG, I'm hoping to make something pretty good out of it.

Finally, I've restyled and reorganised the site again. I wasn't too keen on a lot of elements of the old style, so hopefully this one will be a lot nicer.

There's been a lot going on in my personal life over the last couple of months, and I'm struggling to keep up with everything. Hopefully we'll see this site kept up to date, but no promises there.

Have fun!
