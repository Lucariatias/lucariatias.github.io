Today I discovered an awesome static site generator called Jekyll.
It actually powers GitHub pages, and I thought it would be worth a look.
So, this evening, I integrated Jekyll into my site. This means that writing blog posts in much easier now (no more manual editing of feeds after posts!) and layouts are managed in one file, so I don't have to update it everywhere.
It also uses Liquid, which allows you to use selection statements and loops to generate pages.
I would definitely recommend it for getting blogs up and running; it's very easy to set up and is a huge time saver. It's also a lot simpler than most larger blogging sites, and allows you to have complete control over everything.
